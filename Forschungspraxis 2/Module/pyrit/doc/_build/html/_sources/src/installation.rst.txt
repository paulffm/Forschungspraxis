Installation
============

Preparation
------------
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ is recommended for the installation of Python, and `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/pycharm/>`_ for working with Pyrit. With Anaconda it is also very easy to create virtual environments.
After installation, a virtual environment for Pyrit should be created with::

    $ conda create --name py38 python=3.8

and activated with::

    $ conda activate py38

The Python exe must be selected in the IDE. Required packages are installed automatically based on the defined Pyrit requirements. Besides, packages can be installed manually with::

    $ conda install <package name>

or via pip::

    $ pip install <package name>

Make sure to install packages in the current, activated environment associated with Pyrit.


For users
---------

Clone Pyrit from the gitlab repository.
To install Pyrit, first, navigate to the directory in which you cloned the Pyrit project.
Here, run the following code to install::

    $ pip install -e .


For developers
--------------

If you are a developer of Pyrit, run the following code to install::

    $ pip install -e .[dev]


With the `[dev]` option, some more packages needed for developing are installed.
