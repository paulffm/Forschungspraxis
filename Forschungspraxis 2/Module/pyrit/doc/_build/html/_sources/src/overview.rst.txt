Overview

Pyrit is Python-based a finite element (FE) solver for Maxwells equations in static and quasistatic settings and heat flow in two and three dimensions.
One of the central aims of Pyrit is to provide a user-friendly and computationally efficient FE code with a template-based structure for standard and coupled EM and thermal problems. Furthermore, a plain user interface via Python scripts supports the implementation of new modeling and simulation ideas.
The code is transparent, stable and organized in packages.
Its inherent structure supports students to learn how to implement and use a FE solver.
