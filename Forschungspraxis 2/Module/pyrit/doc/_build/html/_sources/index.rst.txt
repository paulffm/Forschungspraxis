======================================
Welcome to the documentation of Pyrit!
======================================
Pyrit is a field simulation software based on the finite element method
written in Python to solve coupled systems of partial differential equations.
It is designed as a modular software that is easily modifiable and extendable.
The framework can, therefore, be adapted to various activities, i.e. research,
education and industry collaboration.
